Have you got a crowded lander design that needs a spot for rover stowage? Do you want aerodynamic protection for larger probes and satellites? Have a look at DaMichels' Cargo Bays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpherical Tanks! A prettier way to get your fuel.\r\n\r\n#Stats\r\n\r\nThis is a modernization of DaMichel's Cargo Bays developed in KSP 0.25. The configuration files have been brought up to KSP 1.0.5+ balance standards, and no longer require additional addons for their functionality to work. These size 2 cargo bays give some options for cargo storage without using a spaceplane form factor. Their innovative 4-piece doors allow wider cargos to be deployed in tighter spaces, making them great for space stations and interplanetary motherships.\r\n\r\n#License and Permission\r\n\r\nOriginally created by DaMichel.\r\n\r\nUpdated and maintained by [permission from the original author](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55842-partswip-damichels-partsfuselage-r2-2222015/&page=4#comment-2568712).\r\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Attribution, Share Alike)\r\n",
