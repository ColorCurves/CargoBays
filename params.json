Have you got a crowded lander design that needs a spot for rover stowage? Do you want aerodynamic protection for larger probes and satellites? Have a look at DaMichels' Cargo Bays.\r\n\r\n![CargoBaySpaceIllustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/CargoSpaceIllustration.png)\r\n\r\nDo you need the ability to open your cargo bay in cramped quarters? DaMichel's Cargo Bays have an innovative 4-piece door design that allows you to bring wider cargos out in tighter spaces.\r\n\r\n![CargoBayComparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/Comparison%20with%20other%20Cargo%20Bays.png)\r\n![CargoBayinShuttle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/DaMichel's%20Pics/Cargo%20Bay%20on%20shuttle%20-%20Imgur.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnything that fits into a size 2 profile, DaMichel's Cargo Bays can help you store it.\r\n\r\n![CargoBayinSpaceClosed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/DaMichel's%20Pics/Cargo%20Bay%20in%20space%20-%20Imgur.jpg)\r\n![CargoBayinSpaceOpen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/DaMichel's%20Pics/Cargo%20Bay%20in%20space%20open%20-%20Imgur.jpg)\r\n\r\nCargo Bays! They've got you covered.\r\n\r\n#Stats\r\n\r\nThis is a modernization of DaMichel's Cargo Bays developed in KSP 0.25. The configuration files have been brought up to KSP 1.0.5+ balance standards, and no longer require additional addons for their functionality to work. These size 2 cargo bays give some options for cargo storage without using a spaceplane form factor. Their wider-open low-profile doors allow cargos to be deployed in tighter spaces, making them great for space stations and interplanetary motherships.\r\n\r\n#License and Permission\r\n\r\nOriginally created by DaMichel.\r\n\r\nUpdated and maintained by [permission from the original author](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55842-partswip-damichels-partsfuselage-r2-2222015/&page=4#comment-2568712).\r\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Attribution, Share Alike)\r\n",
