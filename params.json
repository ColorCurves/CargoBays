A resource extraction base? Have you ever wanted a different tank option at the 1.25m form factor? DaMichel's Spherical Tanks might just be for you.\r\n\r\n![SphericalTanksStacked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/DaMichel's%20Pics/Spherical%20Tanks%20stacked%20together%20-%20Imgur.jpg)\r\n\r\nWould you like spherical tanks in a variety of sizes and a size 1 connection? These beautiful tanks are suited to any application you can imagine.\r\n\r\n![SpaceplaneAndSphericalTanks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/SpaceplaneAndSphericalTanks.png)\r\n![SphericalTanksShip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorCurves/colorcurves.github.io/master/pictures/DMTanks/DaMichel's%20Pics/Spherical%20Tanks%20ship-%20Imgur.jpg)\r\n\r\nSpherical Tanks! A prettier way to get your fuel.\r\n\r\n#Stats\r\n\r\nThis is a modernization of DaMichel's Cargo Bays developed in KSP 0.25. The configuration files have been brought up to KSP 1.0.5+ balance standards, and no longer require additional addons for their functionality to work. These size 2 cargo bays give some options for cargo storage without using a spaceplane form factor. Their innovative 4-piece doors allow wider cargos to be deployed in tighter spaces, making them great for space stations and interplanetary motherships.\r\n\r\n#License and Permission\r\n\r\nOriginally created by DaMichel.\r\n\r\nUpdated and maintained by [permission from the original author](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55842-partswip-damichels-partsfuselage-r2-2222015/&page=4#comment-2568712).\r\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Attribution, Share Alike)\r\n",
